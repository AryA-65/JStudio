# **JSTUDIO User Guide**

JSTUDIO is a **digital audio workstation (DAW)** that allows users to drag clips onto a track, apply effects, and create music.

## **Getting Started**

1. To get started, simply **drag a sample** from the left side onto the track.
2. Clicking on one of the **plugins** in the **plugins tab** will allow you to add effects to existing **WAV files**. These files will then appear in the **samples tab** under the **Plugin** folder. These can be dragged back onto the tracks. To see the new files saved simply press **CTRL+R**.
3. The **channels tab** allows users to control track parameters, such as stereo (top knob), volume (slider), and pitch (bottom knob).
4. The **pipeline tab** allows for users to add clipping distortion effects to tracks. **WARNING** Right clicking on the distortion will remove, but it cannot be added back.
5. Clicking on the **save button** at the top of the screen will allow you to **save** the song you made to your **music folder**.

## **Available Settings**
- **Light and Dark Mode**
- **Note and Wave Color Selector**
- **Testing Toggle**


## **Testing Functionality**
Select the **checkbox** in the settings page. After, run any plugin, make your adjustments, and press **save/export**. This will open a **spectrometer visualizer** to test the effect.

## **Plugin User Guide:**

### **Adjust the knobs/sliders to set parameters for the desired effects for the following plugins:**

---

### **Reverb:**
This plugin creates a **roomy environment**. Adjusting the knobs allows for different reverbs to be heard.

- **Pre Delay:** The amount of time before the first reflection is heard.
- **Decay:** The amount of time for a reflected wave to decay.
- **Diffusion:** The spacing of the reflected waves.
- **Wet/Dry Mix:** The amount of **original (dry)** and **modified (wet)** audio.
- **Output Gain:** The volume of the audio

---

### **Echo:**
This plugin creates reflected audio waves spaced far apart. Adjusting the knobs allows for different echo effects to be heard.

- **Pre Delay:** The amount of time before the first reflection is heard.
- **Decay:** The amount of time for a reflected wave to decay.
- **Diffusion:** The spacing of the reflected waves.
- **Number of Echoes:** Determines the amount of reflected waves.
- **Wet/Dry Mix:** The amount of **original (dry)** and **modified (wet)** audio.
- **Output Gain:** The volume of the audio

---

### **Flanger:**
This plugin creates a **wooshing effect** by copying the audio and delaying it with **modulated delays**. Adjusting the knobs allows for different flanger effects to be heard.

- **Frequency:** The rate at which the delays are modulated.
- **Deviation:** The amplitude of the oscillating modulation function.
- **Wet/Dry Mix:** The amount of **original (dry)** and **modified (wet)** audio.
- **Output Gain:** The volume of the audio

---

### **Chorus:**
This plugin creates a **multiple instrument/voice effect** by copying the audio and delaying it with modulated delays. Adjusting the knobs allows for different chorus effects to be heard.

- **Frequency:** The rate at which the delays are modulated.
- **Deviation:** The amplitude of the oscillating modulation function.
- **Wet/Dry Mix:** The amount of **original (dry)** and **modified (wet)** audio.
- **Output Gain:** The volume of the audio

---

### **Phaser:**
This plugin creates a **sweeping sound** by copying the audio and shifting the phase with **modulated phase shifts**. Adjusting the knobs allows for different phaser effects to be heard.

- **Frequency:** The rate at which the delays are modulated.
- **Deviation:** The amplitude of the oscillating modulation function.
- **Wet/Dry Mix:** The amount of **original (dry)** and **modified (wet)** audio.
- **Output Gain:** The volume of the audio

---

### **Basic Filter:**
This plugin allows for certain frequencies to be cut off, given a base frequency.

- **Array of Samples:** The audio signal (samples) to which the filter will be applied.
- **Sample Rate:** The sample rate of the audio file.
- **Cut-off Frequencies:** Determines the range of applied frequency values.

#### **Filter Types:**
- **Low-Pass Filter:** Removes all lower frequencies than the cut-off frequency.
- **High-Pass Filter:** Removes all higher frequencies than the given cut-off frequency.

---

### **Biquad Filter:**
This plugin allows for **precise frequency shaping** using various filter types.

- **Array of Samples:** The audio signal (samples) to which the filter will be applied.
- **Sample Rate:** The sample rate of the audio file (measured in Hz).
- **Cut-off Frequency:** The frequency threshold that determines the point at which the filter begins to attenuate the signal.
- **Quality Factor (Q):** A **double value** that controls the resonance or sharpness of the filter.

#### **Filter Types:**
- **Low-Pass Filter (LPF):** Allows frequencies below the cut-off frequency to pass. Removes all frequencies higher than the cut-off frequency. Ideal for removing high-frequency noise.
- **High-Pass Filter (HPF):** Allows frequencies above the cut-off frequency to pass. Removes all frequencies lower than the cut-off frequency. Ideal for removing low-end rumble.
- **Band-Pass Filter (BPF):** Allows a specific range of frequencies centered around a given frequency to pass. Attenuates frequencies outside of the selected range.
- **Band-Stop (Notch) Filter:** Attenuates a specific frequency band around a given center frequency. Allows frequencies outside of the notch to pass.

---

### **Audio Amplitude:**
This plugin enhances the audio by multiplying the amplitude of the signal by a given factor.

- **Array of Samples:** The audio signal (samples) to which the amplitude enhancement will be applied.
- **Sample Rate:** The sample rate of the audio file.
- **Amplification Factor:** A **double value** that multiplies the amplitude of the audio signal (increasing or decreasing its volume).

---

### **Stereo:**
This plugin requires a **mono channel audio file** and applies stereo effects to it.

- **Sample Rate:** The sample rate of the audio file (measured in Hz).
- **Stereo Effect Type:** The stereo effect to be applied, determined by the user's selection.

#### **Filter Types:**
- **HAAS Stereo Effect (HAASStereo):** A delay is applied to create the **Haas effect**, creating the perception of a wider stereo field.
- **LFO Stereo Effect (LFOStereo):** Uses a **low-frequency oscillator (LFO)** to modulate stereo balance, creating a dynamic, evolving stereo effect.
- **Inverted Stereo Effect (InvertedStereo):** Inverts the **left** and **right** stereo channels to create a flipped stereo image.

---

### **Synthesizer:**
Generates **sound waves** based on keyboard inputs with set frequencies, allowing for the creation of synthesized sounds. The plugin also supports adding a **glide effect** and a **speed modifier** to control the pitch transition and speed of the sound.

- **3 Different Oscillators:** Each oscillator has an individual waveform selection (e.g., **sine**, **square**, **triangle**, **saw**).
- **Tone (frequency)** and **Volume** of Each Oscillator: Customize the tone and volume for each of the three oscillators to shape the overall sound.
- **Glide Effect:** A smooth pitch transition between notes for a **legato** feel.
- **Speed Modifier:** Adjust the speed of the sound, altering how quickly or slowly the sound evolves.

#### **Output:**
An audio file (WAV type) containing the played synth sounds.

---

### **Equalizer:**
Modifies the volume of certain frequencies by using an **FFT algorithm** to analyze the amplitude of all frequencies in the audio and adjusting the amplitudes accordingly.

- **Center Frequency Factor:** The factor that multiplies the range around the center frequencies of each slider, allowing for **precise frequency adjustments**.
- **Output Gain:** The volume of the audio

#### **Output:**
Equalized Audio with enhanced frequency balance.
